1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

print([x for x in range(2000 , 3200) if x%7==0 & x%5==0])


2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

first_name = input("Enter first name : ")
last_name = input("Enter last name : ")
print (first_name[::-1] + " " + last_name[::-1])

3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm. Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

import math
def volume_of_sphere(diameter):
    r = diameter/2
    volume = 4/3 * math.pi * pow(r,3)
    print (volume)
diameter = int(input ("enter the diameter of sphere : "))
volume_of_sphere(diameter)
