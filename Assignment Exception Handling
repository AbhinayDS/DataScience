1. Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.

def cal():
    try:
        a=15
        b=8
        c=a/b
    except ZeroDivisionError as zde:
        print("can not divisible by ZERO!  ", zde)
    else:
        print("executed successfully !!")
        print("result : ",c)
cal()

2. Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in
["Americans", "Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in
["Baseball","cricket"].

subjects=["Americans ","Indians"]
verbs=["play","watch"]
objects=["Baseball","Cricket"]

sentencelist = [(sub+' '+vb+' '+ob) for sub in subjects for vb in verbs for ob in objects]
for sentence in sentencelist:
    print(sentence)
